# NRMLC Overview — Symbolic AGI and SPU Integration

This repository introduces the **Nesting Recursive Model Logic Computer (NRMLC)**, a post-binary symbolic computation system designed to drive next-generation artificial intelligence through recursive reasoning, memory decay, and deterministic logic execution.

---

## What Is NRMLC?

NRMLC is a symbolic reasoning framework that operates using real-valued phase logic instead of binary gates. It interprets logic through `.phx` symbolic programs using a stack-based architecture inspired by recursion, decay, and emergent cognition.

---

## Applications in Artificial Intelligence

Unlike neural networks or LLMs, NRMLC supports:

- **Symbolic recursion and memory anchoring**
- **Explainable deterministic logic**
- **Recursive goal mutation and agent chaining**
- **Real-time reasoning at room temperature**

Its architecture enables true symbolic AGI through goal-based, agent-driven computation.

## Integration with ULTRACORE-SPU

NRMLC is designed to operate in tandem with the **ULTRACORE-SPU**, a symbolic processor capable of:

- Room-temperature superconductivity via ΔΦ drift-collapse
- Boron-carbon spiral lattice implementation
- Recursive ΦBus and TES memory matrix integration
- Geometric phase-state signaling instead of charge transport
