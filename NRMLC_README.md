## Project Overview
NRMLC is a post-binary symbolic system based on:
- Recursive goal structures
- Memory decay (τ_eff) and signal strength (s)
- Phase-based recursion and retry logic
- Symbolic agents capable of self-modifying behavior

This system is designed to replace or augment classical and neural computing with adaptable, symbolic cognition.
